<H2> Data Analytics and Society CDT </H2>
<BR>

<P> 
The Data Analytics and Society CDT is a new centre for doctoral training, funded by the ESRC, providing research across four universities:
<LI> University of Leeds</LI>
<LI> University of Manchester</LI>
<LI> University of Liverpool, and</LI>
<LI> University of Sheffield</LI>
<P>The <A href="https://datacdt.org/"> CDT</A> offers four year programmes, encouraging advancements in social science, using methods from computing, mathematics, and the natural sciences. 
Mandatory modules include:
<LI> Researching Society and Culture</LI>
<LI> Understanding Data and their Environment</LI>
<LI> Analysis of Human Dynamics</LI> 
<LI> Social Analytics and Visulatisation, and </LI>
<LI> Programming for Social Science: Core Skills: </LI>
</P>

<P>
Programming for Social Science includes an assignment in which I must develop a series of web pages (these!) displaying my knowledge of <code> html</code>, and create a portfolio of my Python coding for an agent-based model <A href="">Add link here</A>

<H2>PhD Project </H2>
<P> <B>Predictive Geodemographics -</B> 
My PhD project will aim to create a dynamic, predictive geodemographic classification system,  in which will have the ability to predict the social trajectory of individuals throughout their lifetimes, via a heirarchical classification model. 
Such a model will support lifetime evaluations of the geodemographic segment migration of both consumers and citizens. 'Predictive Geodemographics' is in partnership with CallCredit, developers of geodeomographic classifcation system CAMEO. 
<P>
<B>PhD Supervisors:</B> Alexis Comber, Lisa Buckner, and Mark Birkin. <BR>
<B>Notable creative aspect:</B> The development of a lifetime prediction geodemographic classification model, potentially built with R.<BR>
<B>Skills development:</B> Progression of one's programming skills from beginner in Python to advanced R programmer.</P>
