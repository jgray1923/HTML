# HTML

These web pages were created for the GEOG5995 Assignment 1. I spent hours writing and formatting, and writing again, and figuring out more formatting!
However, for the submission, I decided to write my webpages on GitHub in markdown, this is much easier and looks much more professional than my own HTML.
The GitHub markdown although looking more professional, does not feel as rewarding as writing in HTML! Therefore I have pushed these files to GitHub to allow Andy to view (and mark!) them!
