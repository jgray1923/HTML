<H2> Education </H2>
<P>
I have previously completed both my BSc Geography and MSc Geographical Information Systems degrees at Sheffield Hallam University, in 2015 and 2017 respectively. 
My interests have gradually developed from a wide geographical interest, particularaly physical geography, to that of GIS, and further on to the data behind the technology, of which led to my PhD.

<H2> Future Research Interests </H2>
<P>
Beyond my PhD project, I would be intersted in developing upon my MSc Major Research Project, developing an automated program for the analysis of greenspaces, in accordance with an improved ANGSt model. 
I would also like to fulfil gaps in current knowledge regarding geodemographic classification systems, and geodemographics. Other intersts include statistical analysis and spatial modelling, the natural environment and natural hazards, geocomputation, and greenspace analysis.
