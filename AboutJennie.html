<h2> Education </h2>
<p>
I have previously completed both my BSc Geography and MSc Geographical Information Systems degrees at Sheffield Hallam 
  University, in 2015 and 2017 respectively. My interests have gradually developed from a wide geographical interest, 
  particularaly physical geography, to that of GIS, and further on to the data behind the technology, of which led to my PhD. </p>

  program for the analysis of greenspaces, in accordance with an improved ANGSt model. I would also like to fulfil gaps in 
  current knowledge regarding geodemographic classification systems, and geodemographics. Other intersts include statistical 
  analysis and spatial modelling, the natural environment and natural hazards, geocomputation, and greenspace analysis. </p>
